## What is ScriptHookV?

ScriptHookV is a runtime module created to allow **GTA V** to load and execute external `.asi` modifications in **single-player (offline) mode**. It provides the essential scripting bridge used by many community-created extensions. The game automatically disables ScriptHookV in online sessions, keeping multiplayer mode secure and unaffected.

The module allows the game to interface with custom functions written by mod developers. This enables users to expand single-player gameplay features, add utility extensions, introduce new mechanics, and perform offline enhancements safely. ScriptHookV does not modify or interact with online gameplay.

Its workflow supports scripthookv initialization, script hook v latest version compatibility, and clean execution of `.asi` add-ons. This makes it a foundation for a wide range of offline GTA V enhancement tools. Each launch follows a predictable and stable initialization path.

Developers may extend functionality using script hook v dot net, enabling .NET-based scripting for more advanced tools and systems. This makes ScriptHookV suitable for building detailed logic modules for offline gameplay.

ScriptHookV is widely used for legitimate modding tasks such as adjusting offline behavior, adding utility functions, expanding interaction layers, or enhancing the environment. It is isolated from online sessions and intended strictly for single-player mode.

The module includes stable routines to ensure download script hook v processes are placed correctly, initialized properly, and matched to the right version of the game. This promotes reliability for all offline modding workflows.
